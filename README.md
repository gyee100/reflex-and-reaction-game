# Game Description: 
In this game, a user can test out his or her response time as well as reaction time to required commands. For every correct response the user receives a point and for every incorrect response, the user loses a point. In level 1 the user is tested on their reflex time only. They are required to score a minimum of 25 points to advance to the next level. In level 2 the user is tested on both their reflex and reaction time. In order to complete level 2 and win the game, the user is required to score a minimum of 50 points and keep an average of 4.5 seconds reaction time.
